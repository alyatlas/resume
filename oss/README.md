# Major Project Participation

## 2007 - 2009: Joomla

I was a core developer of the [Joomla! CMS](https://www.joomla.com). I head up the release and support teams as well as the security team (including creating a security process from scratch).

## 2012 - 2016: PHP

Core contributor to the [PHP Programming Language](https://www.php.net) driving language features from the PHP 5.5 release through PHP 7. Primarially led two well-known features:

 * [Password Hash Functionality](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_hash) - adding the `password_hash()` family of functions for simplified password storage
 * [Scalar Type Declarations](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5) - Adding support in PHP 7+ for scalar types

Additionally, I was involved in the creation of a large number of other RFCs in an advisory or consultory manner.
