I have spoken at several conferences and events on various topics including Object Oriented Design, Joomla, Security, Performance and Scalability, Programming and MySQL Performance including (but not limited to, more complete list at [Joind.in](https://joind.in/user/ircmaxell/talks)):

## Microservices Gone Wrong

> Microservices are the latest architectural trend to take the PHP community by storm. Is it a good pattern? How can you use it effectively? In this talk, we'll explore real world experience building out a large scale application based around microservices: what worked really well, what didn't work at all, and what we learned along the way. Spoiler alert: we got a lot wrong.

## Anatomy of a Type System

> PHP 7 is coming quickly. One of the major features that it brings with it is the ability to use scalar typing. Are you ready for it? Join me as we take a tour through PHP 7's type system from end to end. Don't know what a type is? Come and find out! Are you a seasoned type user? Come learn how to leverage the new options! Confused about weak vs strict types? We'll cover concept, theory and practical details of the type system while exploring how PHP's type system compares to other languages.

## Beyond Design Patterns

> Many people teach design patterns as a fundamental step to Object Oriented Programming. They are so universally seen as important that almost every single programming conference that I have been to has had at least one talk about them. They are quite often used as interview questions to test a candidate's OOP knowledge. However, just like inheritance, they are not needed for OOP. And just like inheritance, they are a distraction rather than a foundation. Instead of focusing on patterns, I suggest focusing on learning about abstraction and communication. Why? Come and find out!

## High Performance PHP

> PHP powers the majority of the internet. Itâ€™s a fast, scalable and capable language. But how does it work? Why does HHVM appear to be faster, and is it always faster? But more importantly, how does it work internally? How does Recki-CT present such impressive benchmarks compared to other implementations? Is it cheating? Come and learn all of this and more, as we discuss compilers and how they work!

## How PHP Changed The World of Programming

## Code Quality, By The Numbers

> Quite often we hear people talking about how to write better code, how to build systems better or how to leverage new technologies to produce better software. But how can we objectively quantify whether code is good or if it needs improving? How can we analyze an existing codebase to see what parts need improvement without spending weeks reading through the source code? The answer is provided by static analysis tools like pDepend and PHPLOC. But the results that they produce can be extremely cryptic and hard to understand. From acronyms like NPATH and CRAP to metrics like Cyclomatic Complexity and Fanout, there's a whole treasure trove of information just waiting to be descifered. 

> In this talk, we'll explore some of the tools available for measuring software quality. We'll dive into some of the theory behind the metrics that they analyze while looking at some real world applications of those metrics. We'll also explore how to use these tools to gain valuable insight into legacy codebases. Finally, we'll look into methods to integrate those metrics into your development workflow to help improve the quality of the applications that you build.

## Don't be STUPID, Grasp SOLID

> When it comes to Object Oriented Programming, there is no shortage of guidelines and principles for how to properly design an OO system. There is also no shortage of acronyms to describe these principles: DRY, SRP, LSP, LoD, ISP, OCP, etc. However, there are two acronyms that really shine through to describe how to, and how not to do OOP well. The two acronyms are SOLID and STUPID (respectively). We'll discuss some of the underlying principles of Object Oriented Programming, and how we can learn from the principles identified by each of these two acronyms. Additionally, we'll explore some additional anti-patterns of Object Oriented Design and how they can be avoided. Finally, we'll talk about how all of this applies to our every day development tasks, and the real-world benefit these design principles provide...

## PHP, Under The Hood

> PHP is one of the most popular open source programming languages in the world. It powers some of the highest traffic sites in the world, and at the same time it powers some of the lowest traffic sites in the world. But have you ever wondered how it works under the hood? Have you been overwelmed by the thought of looking at the C code that runs PHP? Well, this talk is for you! We're going to explore how PHP works under the hood, by looking at a PHP implementation of it: PHPPHP!

> Have you ever wondered what an OPCODE Cache is really doing? Have you ever wondered what a T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM is? Have you ever wondered why an interpreted languages has a compiler? We'll explore all of these topics, and more! And the best part of it all? You don't need to know C to understand the details! Using PHPPHP, we can explore the language details in a high level language, where things like memory management don't get in the way of the real content. If you've ever wanted to know how PHP works, this is the talk for you!

## Cryptography for the Average Developer

> Every developer at one point or another needs to implement some form of cryptography in one of their applications. Whether it's hashing passwords or encrypting sensitive user data, the security requirements are daunting. Yet you don't need to be an expert in cryptography to implement it correctly. All you need to do is understand the basics, and trust the experts.  In this talk, we'll take a look at some of the basic concepts of cryptography and how to implement them in PHP. Additionally, we'll discuss the common problems that developers face and how best to solve them. Finally, we'll dispel some of the myth and rumors around password hashing and how (and more importantly why) to do it properly.

## Life of an IF Statement

> The humble if statement: so simple, so short, so trivial. But do you know how it works? I mean, how it *really* works? Join us on a trip down the rabbit hole to find out! Our journey will take us from PHP to C, from Assembly to Machine code, from CPU to Transistor and beyond. We'll discover all sorts of interesting things you many never have known about programming, physics and even the universe itself... I can't promise that you'll return from the depths of the CPU, but if you do, you will not be the same.
